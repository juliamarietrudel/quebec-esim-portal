<!-- STEPS -->
1) Checkout + Payment

User completes checkout (guest allowed ✅).

_____

2) Webhook handler: different scenarios

When you receive the paid order:

A) Validate the order
	•	Verify webhook signature
	•	Confirm financial_status == paid
	•	Ensure required line item properties exist (plan/product id, intent)

B) Idempotency guard (very important)

Check your DB:
	•	If OrderProvisioning already exists with status completed → do nothing
	•	If processing → do nothing (or resume)
	•	If failed → decide retry rules (see below)

⸻

3) Resolve “who is this customer?”

Inputs you likely have
	•	email (always)
	•	shopify_customer_id (sometimes, even for guests Shopify may create/associate)
	•	phone (optional)

Resolution logic
	1.	Find CustomerIdentity by shopify_customer_id if present
	2.	Else find by normalized email
	3.	Else create new CustomerIdentity

If CustomerIdentity has maya_customer_id: reuse it
Else: create Maya customer (Connectivity POST /customer/) with:
	•	email, name, country
	•	tag: stable value (recommended: emailhash_<hash> or shopify_customer_<id>)

Save maya_customer_id in your DB.

⸻

4) Decide per line item: New eSIM vs Top up vs Multi-eSIM order

Loop through each eSIM line item.

Scenario 1 — First-time buyer (new eSIM)

Goal: issue a new eSIM and attach plan.

Typical steps (you’ll map to Maya endpoints you have access to):
	1.	Choose Maya product/plan based on line item
	2.	Create/allocate eSIM (or “order plan” that returns eSIM)
	3.	Associate eSIM + plan to maya_customer_id
	4.	Get QR / activation details
	5.	Save esim_id/iccid, qr_url, plan_id in DB
	6.	Email customer instructions + QR

Status transitions:
created → provisioning → waiting_for_qr → completed

Scenario 2 — Returning buyer, wants another new eSIM

Same as scenario 1, but:
	•	reuse existing maya_customer_id
	•	you create a new eSIMAsset record under the same customer

Scenario 3 — Returning buyer, top-up existing eSIM

You must know what to top up. Options:

3A) User selects an existing eSIM in UI (best UX)
	•	They choose from “My eSIMs” list (requires you to show history by email link or magic link)
	•	You get esim_id/iccid directly

3B) User enters an identifier (ICCID / eSIM ID / email + last 4 digits)
	•	You validate it belongs to them (match to DB record by email)
	•	If mismatch → manual review / support flow

Then:
	1.	Find eSIMAsset for that user + identifier
	2.	Purchase/add plan/top-up on that eSIM
	3.	Save new plan_id and update status
	4.	Email confirmation

Status transitions:
created → topup_processing → completed

Scenario 4 — Mixed cart (new eSIM + top-up in one order)

Process each line item independently.
	•	If any line fails, you still fulfill the ones that succeeded.
	•	Email should reflect partial fulfillment (and you flag support).

⸻

5) Failure and retry scenarios (critical)

Failure types & what to do

A) Maya returns 401/403 (no access)
	•	Mark order failed_auth
	•	Alert you + client immediately
	•	Do not retry automatically

B) Network timeout / 5xx
	•	Retry with backoff (e.g., 3 tries: 10s, 60s, 5m)
	•	Must be idempotent (don’t create duplicates)

C) Duplicate customer/email conflict
	•	Search existing customer by email (if endpoint exists) or use DB mapping
	•	Reuse existing maya_customer_id

D) Plan unavailable / product mismatch
	•	Mark failed_configuration
	•	Send internal alert; email user “we’re verifying your plan” (optional)

E) QR/activation not returned immediately
	•	Mark waiting_for_qr
	•	Poll a GET endpoint (or schedule a retry) until QR available
	•	Then send email

⸻

6) Email delivery scenarios

New eSIM email includes
	•	QR code (or download link)
	•	activation steps (iOS/Android)
	•	plan details
	•	support contact
	•	order number

Top-up email includes
	•	confirmation of top-up
	•	plan details + expiry
	•	no QR (unless plan requires re-download, usually not)

⸻

7) “My eSIMs” page (recommended even without accounts)

Since you don’t want user accounts, you can still offer:
	•	“Send me my eSIMs” form (email)
	•	Magic link to list their past eSIMs/top-ups (tokenized link)
	•	This makes top-up UX much easier and reduces support.


SUMMARY
	1.	Verify webhook signature (security)
	2.	Make the handler idempotent (so retries don’t double-provision)
	3.	Resolve Maya customer (create if needed)
	4.	Parse the order into “actions” based on the products bought
	5.	Execute actions (create eSIM / top up / change / delete)
	6.	Email results (QR codes, confirmations)
